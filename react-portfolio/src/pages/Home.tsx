        Welcome to my portfolio

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        I’m a curious and driven IT student in my second year of the Master of
        Science in Information Technology program. I have a strong interest in
        programming and software development, and I’m passionate about problem
        solving and constantly learning new things.

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        What I enjoy most about programming is that it involves every aspect of
        problem solving—from analyzing and understanding a problem to designing
        and building effective solutions. I like breaking problems down,
        exploring different approaches, and truly understanding how the systems
        I work with function.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I enjoy challenging myself and find it exciting to learn new
        technologies and ways of working, especially when I get to apply them in
        practical contexts. To me, programming isn’t just about writing
        code—it’s about creating smart, well-thought-out solutions that work in
        the real world.
