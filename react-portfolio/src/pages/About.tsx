      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
        Before I started studying IT, I spent some time exploring different
        paths and wasn't quite sure what I wanted to do — but once I discovered
        programming and system development, everything clicked. I’ve always
        enjoyed learning new things, and when I found this field, it felt like I
        had finally found the right fit.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I grew up playing hockey, which taught me a lot about teamwork and gave
        me the discipline and drive to constantly improve. I also enjoy training
        and have a general interest in sports and health.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        Outside of my studies, I spend a lot of time reading — both courses and
        articles — and I like diving deeper into topics like programming,
        productivity, and learning. I enjoy building my own projects to try out
        new ideas and techniques, and I thrive both when collaborating with
        others and when I’m working solo and focusing deeply on a problem.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        I’d describe myself as analytical, quick to learn, and someone who
        naturally takes on a leadership role in group projects. I like taking
        responsibility, bringing structure to things, and driving them forward
        in an efficient way.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mt-4">
        As I mentioned, this is something I genuinely enjoy — which means that
        grades have often come as a bonus rather than a goal. I've never been
        driven by achieving the highest possible results, but by understanding
        and learning. Whenever I’ve had the chance to choose projects, I’ve
        always gone for the ones that seemed most challenging or interesting —
        regardless of how it might affect the grade. What motivates me is the
        process of learning itself — digging into something, understanding how
        it works, and feeling like I’m truly developing.
